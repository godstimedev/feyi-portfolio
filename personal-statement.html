			<p>
				Leadership is built on strong core values and ethics, which help in providing optimal care to
				patients. Leadership will also build a legacy and a code of standards for the best caregiving
				procedures. Hence, my core values as a leader are; eloquent communication skills that will not
				be lost in the transmission, kindness, justice, diversity, equity, inclusivity, collaboration,
				continuous learning, and human relationships. These core values are the tools to build my
				leadership skills and let me make the right decisions autonomously. As a nursing student, I
				aspire to be an exemplary leader who upholds the value of the healthcare system. Also, be an
				exemplary model who inspires and motivates nursing students to achieve their career goals,
				through my work ethic.

				<br />
				<br />

				I have been able to emulate leadership skills from my colleagues, including nurses, and clinical
				observers. I have been able to observe that the unifying trait of their leadership style is
				organization and action. With these, I will imbibe them into my leadership skills so, healthcare
				professionals will always meet their learning objectives when they come into contact with me.
				Also, I will always look for moments to learn and upskill myself, I will always attend formal
				events and seminars to strengthen my leadership skills. I will accept personal and social
				accountability, and I will continually assess my attitudes and deeds to see if they support
				improvements in the healthcare system.
