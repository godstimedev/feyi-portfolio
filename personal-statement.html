				<p>
					Leadership is built on solid core values and ethics, which help provide optimal patient care.
					Leadership will also build a legacy and a code of standards for the best caregiving procedures.
					Hence, my core values as a leader are eloquent communication skills that will not be lost in
					transmission, kindness, justice, diversity, equity, inclusivity, collaboration, continuous
					learning, and human relationships. These core values are the tools to build my leadership
					skills and let me make the right decisions autonomously. As a nursing student, I aspire to be
					an exemplary leader who upholds the values and ethics of the healthcare system.

					<br />
					<br />

					I have been able to emulate leadership skills during my practical experiences with clinical
					educators, unit managers, clinical instructors, and charge nurses. This has helped me observe
					that the unifying trait of their leadership style is teamwork and effective communication. I
					intend to imbibe these skills as I practice as a registered nurse shortly.
					<br />
					<br />

					I will always look for moments to learn and upskill myself by attending formal events and
					seminars to strengthen my leadership skills. Finally, reflecting on my actions will give me
					insights into my evaluation and the best possible ways to handle future challenges with
					colleagues when providing optimal patient care.
