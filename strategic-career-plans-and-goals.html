				<h2>Vision Statement</h2>
				<p>
					I am currently a Nursing student at the prestigious North-Western Polytechnic. I am in my
					fourth year and looking to finish the entire course by December 2023. My vision is to be a
					professional Registered Nurse (RN) providing optimal care with ethical conduct from the
					Canadian Nurse Association (CNA). The Government of Alberta awarded me the ‘Jason Lang’
					Scholarship as an honor student. Currently, I work at the Canadian Mental Health and Disability
					Services (CMHA) as a support worker. I am dedicated and disciplined at my workplace, which I do
					with compassion and empathy. Over the years of practicing, I have been able to work with
					leaders who are very impactful with instructions, thereby helping with my competence skills. My
					clinical experiences have helped me to be independent and built my courage to work diligently.
					Furthermore, I have worked with people with varied ideologies and cultural exposure. These have
					oriented me toward cultural sensitivity, equality, diversity, and inclusivity. In addition, I
					have shown core values as a nurse, in areas like self-discipline, team spirit, collaboration,
					confidentiality, and patient-centered care. Becoming a registered nurse has always been my
					lifelong goal, and I look forward to caring for my patients and their families.
